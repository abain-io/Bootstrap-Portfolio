            <img src="assets/images/andrewBain.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Andrew Bain">

            <p>Throughout my 20+ year (SaaS) sales career, I have been fortunate to have had the opportunity to negotiate and
                develop strategic business partnerships and successfully contribute to several notable teams and global enterprises
                (including LinkedIn)!</p>

            <p>I recently decided to dive in and go for it (and learn how to code)! Thankfully, I was accepted into the Full-Stack
                Web Development Program at UT Austin, and am pursuing my passion for web development and coding. I am currently
                immersed in Front-end development coursework that includes: HTML5 • CSS3 • JavaScript • and jQuery.</p>

            <p>I have a relentless devotion to continuously progress as a developer, and enjoy helping people solve meaningful
                real-world problems with data-driven results.</p>
